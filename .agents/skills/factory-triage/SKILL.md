description: Triage the lesson candidates this repo owns (a bundle source repo's core or org queue, or a repo's own lessons). Cluster them into families, then build one lesson branch, one commit per cluster, and open its review, the only gate. Pass a candidate file for one fact, or nothing for the whole queue.

# Triage

Reflect runs hand lessons over as **candidates**. A candidate is one JSON file under `~/.agents/factory/candidates/<core|org|repo>/`; a `repo` candidate names the repo that owns it. It holds the kind, the skill, a summary, evidence pointers, an optional draft patch, and the `fixedWhen` signal. Triage turns the queue into **clusters**, which are lesson families. Each cluster becomes one commit on one lesson branch, and the user reviews the branch once. **Nothing before the review asks the user anything**: clustering, building and proving run on their own, and the review gate is where every keep, drop, split or never is decided. A cluster's size is the count that matters: one rule from three sightings beats three rules from one sighting each.

`lessons.mjs` below is `.agents/skills/factory-reflect/scripts/lessons.mjs`. In a bundle's own repo, where core isn't installed, it's `<core bundle>/factory-reflect/scripts/lessons.mjs`.

## 1. Check the home repo and read the queue

```bash
node .agents/skills/factory-context/scripts/resolve.mjs     # project.root, adapters
node <lessons.mjs> queue                                    # per scope: its source repo, candidates, ages
```

Triage only the queues this session's repo owns (`project.root`'s main checkout): the `core` or `org` scope when this is its source repo, and the `repo` queue whose `repo` is this checkout. A queue owned by another repo is that repo's work. Give its `start` command and `prompt`, then go on.

- **One fact** (you were given a candidate file): take that candidate, plus the queued candidates for the same skill (`queue --skill <its skill>`), because a fix to that file should account for them. Leave the rest for the scheduled run.
- **Whole queue** (no file): every queued candidate this repo owns.
- **Scheduled** (`--scheduled`): the triage schedule, or a session start that found the queue due, opened this session. Take the whole queue. Run straight through to the review gate.

Drop what's already decided. `lessons.mjs known --never` lists the families the user refused. A candidate in one of them goes straight to `done --outcome dropped`.

## 2. Cluster

Read each candidate. Open its evidence when the summary leaves the *why* unclear: grep the transcript for its `grep` words, or read the PR thread. A transcript that no longer exists is fine: the summary and the PR links are enough.

Group candidates that the same edit would fix: the same skill section, the same missing check, the same wrong fact. Similar wording isn't enough. Two candidates belong together when one commit settles both.

Rank the clusters by size (largest first), then by cost: a fact with a draft patch is cheap, and a new check is dear. For each cluster, write:

- a **slug**: the family name, which is also the fingerprint for `never`
- its **members**: the candidate files
- the **edit**: which file changes, and how (a check, a rule, a skill edit, a fact)
- its **fixedWhen**: the members' signals, merged

**Don't stop to show the clusters.** List them in one short message and go straight to §3: each cluster's slug, members and edit become its commit, so the user judges them in the review, on the diff. There they may drop a commit, ask for a split, or mark a family `never` (factory-reflect's gate step says how each annotation is applied). If the user writes in this chat first to drop or merge a cluster, do that before building.

## 3. One lesson branch, one commit per cluster

Follow factory-reflect's [Landing a lesson branch](../factory-reflect/SKILL.md#landing-a-lesson-branch), from step 2, with `--slug triage-<YYYY-MM-DD>` (or `triage-<candidate slug>` for one fact). A repo-scope branch in a team repo lands through a PR (that section's `lessonLanding` rule). For each cluster:

- Make the edit in the worktree. Apply a member's draft patch when it still fits; otherwise write the edit (read `writing-for-agents` first). Prove a check: it must go **red** on the past mistake before it goes green.
- A `harness` cluster edits the bundle's `harness/<claude-code|codex>.json` (hooks and permission rules only; a broad allow such as `Bash(*)` is refused). `factory harness` shows what it would change in the user's settings; prove a guard hook by running it on the past command. After the land, factory-core's trunk hook runs `factory harness --apply`, which merges it and keeps a backup; where that hook isn't installed, the status hook says to run it.
- Commit it on its own. The subject is the edit. The body quotes the evidence grep hits, one line each, and ends with trailers: `Candidates:` (the member files' basenames) and `Fixed-when:` (the merged signal).

Then do the landing steps in order: the internal-data screen, the review gate (with the head noted), land, and push. A cluster dropped in review is reverted on the branch before landing: `git rebase --onto` past its commit.

## 4. Close the candidates

After the land, mark each member:

```bash
node <lessons.mjs> done --file <candidate> --outcome landed --commit <its cluster's commit on trunk>
node <lessons.mjs> done --file <candidate> --outcome dropped    # dropped in step 1, 2 or the review
```

`done` moves the candidate and its draft to `done/`, and keeps them there for 90 days. When the branch stays undecided (the gate was dismissed), leave the candidates queued. The status hook names the branch at the next session start here, and `lessons.mjs open` lists it.

## 5. Tools, cadence and report

Check the pinned CLIs against their latest releases: `node .agents/skills/factory-tool-sync/scripts/check-tools.mjs --online` (in a bundle repo, `<core bundle>/factory-tool-sync/scripts/check-tools.mjs --online --skills <core bundle>`). Name each `CHANGED` or `BELOW` tool in the report message. Moving a pin is a `factory-tool-sync` review, not part of this run.

Record the run, with the size of the largest cluster: `node <lessons.mjs> cadence --scope <scope> --ran --clusters <largest>` (for a repo queue, `--scope repo --repo <this checkout>`). The script sets the mode: daily until two quiet weeks, then weekly, and back to daily on an early trigger (a queue of 5 or more, a candidate 3 or more days old, a cluster of 3 or more, or a lesson whose signal didn't drop). The status hook nudges by that mode. Say when it switches, and why. The user can pin a mode: `cadence --pin daily|weekly`, or `--pin off`.

Write the trend report: `node <lessons.mjs> report`. It writes one HTML file per layer under `~/.agents/factory/reports/`, from the counted metrics every session's end captures. It shows weekly per-session rates, a marker for each landed lesson, and each lesson's `fixedWhen` signal for the 7 days before and after. Each lesson carries a `verdict`, split by the revision each session had installed when its land recorded `--commit`, else by date. **flat**: it didn't work, so queue a `pattern` candidate that says so, and the next triage reopens that cluster. **worse** (listed in the report's `worse`): it made things worse, so queue a `fact` candidate to revert or rework it, with the commit as evidence (`{"commit":"<sha>"}`).

End with a short summary here: the repo, the clusters with their member counts, what landed and what was dropped, the candidates still queued, and the report's path.
